- https://github.com/bhatt-piyush/Infrared-Search-and-Track
A technical report on infrared search and track (IRST) system for small target detection in infrared images.
Improved the time complexity by 34.80% and probability of detection by 12.75% of ‘Infrared Patch Image’ model while keeping the False Alarm Rate still close to 1 false-alarm-per-image.
